Quick Start Templates for **[Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org)** + **[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)** + **[Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/)**

**Vutron** is a preconfigured template for developing `Electron` cross-platform desktop apps. It uses `Vue 3` and allows you to build a fast development environment with little effort.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT! This project has been moved to a new repository. ⚠️

This repository uses the **Webpack 5 bundler** and is no longer maintained.

**Vutron** now uses the **[ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev)** compiler for faster and easier builds. To use the main template, go to the main repository to learn more: https://github.com/jooy2/vutron

## Documentation

The `webpack` based **Vutron** project documentation is no longer available.
Please see the [documentation page](https://vutron.jooy2.com) for the new [Vutron based on Vite](https://github.com/jooy2/vutron).

Some documentation content may differ from that in the `webpack` repository.
