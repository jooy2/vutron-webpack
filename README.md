## Installation

To configure this project, the `NodeJS` version must be at least **17.1.x** or higher. (Verified and stable version is 17.1 or higher, but there doesn't seem to be any issues with NodeJS 16.16 either.)

Click **[Use this template](https://github.com/jooy2/vutron/generate)** to instantly create your own project.

OR, Clone this repo using below command.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jooy2/vutron <PROJECT_NAME>
```

After cloning the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
$ npm i
```

## Run in development environment

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

## Build

Once the module installation is complete, you can simply build the platform package with the command below.

```shell
# For Windows (.exe, .appx)
$ npm run build:win

# For macOS (.dmg)
$ npm run build:mac

# For Linux (.rpm, .deb, .snap)
$ npm run build:linux
```

### What do I need to do for a multi-platform build?

**macOS** is recommended if you want to build multiple platforms simultaneously on one platform. Because it can be configured with just a few very simple settings.

You can perform multi-platform builds at once with the following command. Alternatively, you can just do it for the OS you want via the individual build commands above.

```shell
$ npm run build
```

`Multipass` configuration may be required for Linux builds. Learn more about `Multipass` through the following link: https://multipass.run/
